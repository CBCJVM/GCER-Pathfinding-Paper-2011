Path-finding with Dijkstra's Algorithm
======================================

As we develop and advance in the Botball competition, the need arises to build
more and more intelligent systems. Path-finding isn't only about reducing the
repetitive work on programmers, but also allowing robots to make decisions on
the fly. As an alternative to techniques such as line-following, or as an aid,
path-finding can take advantage of the largely static Botball board layout. This
paper seeks to describe a technique and example implementation by which a
perfectly optimal, non-intersecting, easily navigable path can be found. In
addition, this document outlines surrounding support systems for working with
such paths, and putting things into practice.
